Visualization of Missing Values
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data_cleaning_summary = pd.DataFrame({
    "Column": ["transaction_date", "item", "quantity", "price_per_unit", "total_spent", "payment_method", "location"],
    "Missing_Percent": [4.6, 9.7, 4.8, 5.3, 5.0, 31.8, 39.6]
})

plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.barplot(
    x="Column",
    y="Missing_Percent",
    data=data_cleaning_summary,
    palette="Set2"
)
plt.title("üßπ Data Cleaning: Percentage of Missing Values by Column", fontsize=16)

Key Takeaways:

location and payment_method have the highest missing rates, limiting branch-level or payment-based insights.

Low-to-moderate missing values in item, quantity, price_per_unit, and total_spent were imputed to maintain analytical continuity.

Visualization communicates data quality clearly before moving to revenue and performance analysis.

üîë Business Questions & Insights
1Ô∏è‚É£ Which category drives more revenue: Drinks or Snacks?

Approach: Grouped items into Snacks (Cookie, Salad, Cake, Sandwich) and Drinks (Coffee, Tea, Smoothie, Juice). Aggregated revenue and sales volume.

Insight: Snacks generate higher revenue overall, though volumes are similar. Top performers: Juice and Salad. Lowest performers: Tea and Cookies.

Actionable: Consider bundling high-volume, low-revenue items with bestsellers to improve revenue.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Are high-selling items profitable?

Insight: Quantity alone does not explain revenue differences ‚Äî some items sell in high volumes but contribute less revenue.

Actionable: Use this to design bundles or promotions targeting items that underperform in revenue but sell frequently.

3Ô∏è‚É£ What are the busiest days?

Approach: Classified days as Weekday (Mon‚ÄìFri) vs Weekend (Sat‚ÄìSun) using transaction_date. Aggregated revenue and transaction counts. Excluded rows with imputed dates (~4.6%).

Insight: Weekdays and weekends show distinguishable patterns in sales volume.

Actionable: Optimize staffing, stock, and promotions according to peak periods.

4Ô∏è‚É£ How do payment methods impact sales?

Approach: Aggregated revenue and transaction counts by payment_method, including ‚ÄúUndefined‚Äù for missing/erroneous data.

Insight: Cash, Credit Card, and Digital Wallet perform almost identically. ‚ÄúUndefined‚Äù is the largest category, highlighting data capture issues.

Actionable:

Implement loyalty programs and promotions for popular payment methods.

Fix data capture to uncover trends for targeted campaigns.

5Ô∏è‚É£ What cross-selling opportunities exist?

Insight: Without customer IDs, segmentation is limited.

Actionable: Introduce customer tracking to enable cross-selling (e.g., pairing drinks with snacks: 2 Tea + 3 Cookies).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Time-based performance

Insight: Daily line plots are noisy; aggregation or rolling averages recommended.

Actionable: Focus on aggregated trends for operational and promotional decision-making.

üöÄ Suggested Strategies

Price Optimization: Adjust prices for high-volume, low-revenue items.

Bundling & Promotions: Bundle high-performing items with underperforming ones.

Operational Efficiency: Allocate staffing and stock based on trends.

Customer Tracking & Loyalty Programs: Enable cross-selling opportunities.

Improve Data Capture: Reduce ‚ÄúUndefined‚Äù entries to improve insights.

üîÆ Expanded Next Steps / Further Analysis

Customer Segmentation

Background: Without customer IDs, it‚Äôs difficult to understand purchasing behavior and frequency.

Data-Driven Opportunity: By implementing unique customer tracking (loyalty cards, email-based accounts, or digital payments), we can segment customers by spending patterns, purchase frequency, and product preferences.

Expected Impact: Enables personalized promotions, identifies high-value customers, and provides cross-selling opportunities.

Time-Series Forecasting for Demand Prediction

Background: Daily sales trends show variability, and weekend/weekday effects are observable but noisy due to missing/imputed transaction dates.

Data-Driven Opportunity: Aggregating sales at a weekly or hourly level and applying forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) can predict demand for each item.

Expected Impact: Optimizes inventory management, reduces stock-outs, and ensures sufficient preparation for high-demand periods.

Market Basket Analysis for Cross-Selling

Background: Caf√© items often complement each other (e.g., drinks and snacks). Current dataset lacks customer-level identification.

Data-Driven Opportunity: With customer tracking, we can analyze which items are frequently purchased together and create bundles or promotional combinations.

Expected Impact: Increases average transaction value, improves revenue from underperforming items, and enhances customer experience.

Interactive Dashboard Implementation

Background: Static reports provide insights but are limited in accessibility and interactivity.

Data-Driven Opportunity: Using tools like Streamlit or Power BI, we can create dashboards showing revenue by item, category, day type, and payment method.

Expected Impact: Enables real-time monitoring, supports operational decisions, and provides an easily interpretable interface for management.

Improving Data Quality & Collection Processes

Background: High percentages of missing values in payment_method (31.8%) and location (39.6%) limit analysis.

Data-Driven Opportunity: Standardizing data entry, enforcing mandatory fields, or integrating digital payment tracking can reduce errors.

Expected Impact: More accurate revenue, transaction, and trend analysis, enabling branch-level insights and reliable segmentation.

üèÅ Conclusion

This analysis provides a fundamental understanding of caf√© performance, highlighting revenue drivers, operational trends, and opportunities for revenue optimization. By combining cleaned data, category analysis, and payment insights, it enables actionable strategies for promotions, inventory management, and cross-selling.
