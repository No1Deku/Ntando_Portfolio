üóÇÔ∏è 1. Project Objective (What & Why)

Goal: Build a retail sales-performance dashboard that analyzes customer behavior, sales, cancellations, and product performance to uncover insights and propose strategic actions.

Target Audience: Executives and decision-makers (not just data teams)

üõ†Ô∏è 2. Data Understanding

Your dataset includes:

Invoices (some start with 'C' ‚Üí cancellations)

Product info (StockCode, Description, Price, Quantity)

Customer info (CustomerID, Country)

Timestamps (InvoiceDate)

Data Challenges Identified:

Missing descriptions

Negative or zero Quantity/Price (returns or giveaways)

Missing CustomerID (guest/anonymous shoppers)

UK-heavy dataset (imbalanced country distribution)

üßπ 3. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Create key flags:

IsCancellation: Invoice starts with 'C'

IsGiveaway: Price or quantity ‚â§ 0

IsReturn: Negative quantity

IsGuestCustomer: Missing CustomerID

Other cleaning steps:

Impute missing descriptions using most frequent Description per StockCode

Exclude or carefully handle negative-value rows from revenue calculations

üìä 4. Exploratory Data Checks (EDA)

Run quality checks on:

Missing data: By column (especially CustomerID, Description)

Date ranges: Ensure all dates fall within expected period

Country distribution: Transactions, revenue, cancellations per country

Product performance: Sales volume, return rates, avg. price per product

Customer activity: Transaction frequency and value per customer

Anomalies: Unusual spikes or patterns in time series

üéØ 5. Executive-Level Business Questions
Area	Key Questions	Strategic Value
Cancellations & Giveaways	What is the financial impact of cancellations and giveaways?	Identify cost-saving opportunities
	Which customers or products have high cancellation/return rates?	Improve retention, product quality
Customer Behavior	Do guest customers cancel more often than registered ones?	Detect potential fraud or satisfaction issues
	How loyal are different segments?	Tailor retention strategies
Country Insights	Beyond the UK, which markets show revenue or customer growth potential?	Localize strategies to grow other markets
Product Strategy	Which products are frequently returned or canceled?	Adjust recommendations, pricing, or suppliers
üß† 6. Customer Segmentation (RFM + K-Means)

Use Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) analysis:

Recency = Days since last purchase

Frequency = Total number of purchases

Monetary = Total spend

Steps:

Filter out cancellations and giveaways

Aggregate per customer

Scale RFM features

Use K-means clustering (Elbow Method to choose k)

Label clusters meaningfully (e.g., ‚ÄúLoyal Big Spenders‚Äù, ‚ÄúAt-Risk One-Timers‚Äù)

Enhancements:

Add flags like CancellationRate, IsGuest, GiveawayCount to enrich clusters

Perform RFM over time (e.g. quarterly) to track customer evolution

Compare cluster distribution by country

Overlay with product preferences (top products per segment)

üìà 7. Dashboard Design Suggestions

Structure by strategic themes, not just raw KPIs.

Section	Visuals	Insights Provided
Sales Overview	KPIs, line charts	Revenue trends, AOV, order volumes
Cancellations & Giveaways	Bar charts, KPI cards	Loss impact, customer/product breakdowns
Customer Segments (RFM)	Cluster visual, tables	Loyalty, value, risk profiles
Product Performance	Bar charts, return rates	Identify problematic or high-performing products
Country-Level Insights	Map, bar charts	Compare markets for growth or decline
Fraud / Risk Patterns	Heatmaps, anomaly detection	Guest customer risk, suspicious behavior trends

Design Tips:

Use filters: Time, Country, Segment

Tell a story: Start with what‚Äôs working ‚Üí highlight problems ‚Üí offer solutions

Avoid over-slicing sparse countries/data ‚Äî group small ones

üìå 8. Final Considerations

Watch out for:

Sparse country data: May skew insights. Group or ignore low-volume ones.

Outlier customers or products: Check if they‚Äôre distorting metrics.

Cancellations lagging over time: Look at time between purchase & cancel.

Stretch goals (optional):

Predictive model for churn or cancellation

Customer Lifetime Value estimation

Seasonality adjustments

Overlay external data (e.g. holidays, promotions)
